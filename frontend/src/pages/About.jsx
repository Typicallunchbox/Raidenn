            Raidenn is a project which was created as a portfolio piece. It was also to be a challenge as
            new packages were used in Raidenn the creator had never used before. It will be going
            through many version updates, which will include improvements to the UX as well as new backend
            functionality. The premise of this project for the creator was also o practise his design skills
            and animation skills. All clip animations(WebM Format) on the site were hand crafted for this 
            project. Any and all feedback is welcome on this project, drop me an email and I will be sure
            to check it out.
